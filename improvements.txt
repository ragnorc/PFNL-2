- The system should be able to deal with synonyms and hyponyms. For example, asking whether the sofa is red or the coach is red should be equivalent.
Similarly for hyponyms, entering "John eats a Mango" should give a positive truth valuation to the question "Does John eat a fruit?". 
This could be implemented by keeping track of such relationships in our lexicon or, alternatively, querying other databases or APIs 
that store synonyms and other lexical relations and comparing them with our query. A good API is https://www.wordsapi.com/.

- Using more rules of inference alongside the modus ponens would also significantly improve our system. 
Examples include the modus tollens or the frequently ocurring hypothetical syllogism. 

- A simple improvement would be to expand our CFG to enable more sophisticated questions and statements. For instance, we could
add sentences that not only involve the accusative (object) and nominative (subject) but also the ablative or genitive 
and consequently add the respective interrogative pronouns to S such as "What", "Where" or "Whose".
